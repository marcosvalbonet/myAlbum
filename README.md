# My Album

## Decision Justification

- I used Retrofit for its easy integration with coroutines and JSON support.
- Room was chosen for local storage because it's part of Jetpack and has direct integration with Flow.
- I followed Clean Architecture to separate responsibilities and facilitate unit testing.
